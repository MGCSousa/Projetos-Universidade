# Projeto-CP
University group project about *F-algebra* using **Haskell**.

CP stands for CÃ¡lculo de Programas, literally meaning "Program calculation". 

This subject aspires to teach not to make mistakes when programming and developing software. With different mathematical approaches, we can calculate the program that we want to do, assuring that no mistakes or bugs were made.

This project consists on different types of exercises that were intended to solve using a *F-algebra* approach.
